# Kitson et al Cratopine Biogeography - Metadata

This folder contains the additional files required for tree plotting and analysis. The files are as follows:

- [BioGeoBEARS_islands.txt](https://github.com/James-Kitson/Biogeography/blob/master/Metadata/BioGeoBEARS_islands.txt) - The distribution file for BioGeoBEARS.
- [BioGeoBEARS_latlong.txt](https://github.com/James-Kitson/Biogeography/blob/master/Metadata/BioGeoBEARS_latlong.txt) - The locations of islands for calculating interisland distances.
- [BioGeoBEARS_dist.txt](https://github.com/James-Kitson/Biogeography/blob/master/Metadata/BioGeoBEARS_dist.txt) - A matrix of interisland distances required by BioGeoBEARS to implement the +x model parameter.
- [BioGeoBEARS_dist_scale.txt](https://github.com/James-Kitson/Biogeography/blob/master/Metadata/BioGeoBEARS_dist_scale.txt) - The same matrix but rescaled between zero and one to help with model calculations.
- [Multilocus_names.csv](https://github.com/James-Kitson/Biogeography/blob/master/Metadata/Multilocus_names.csv) - A datafile containing MrBayes codes and informative names for main manuscript tree plotting.
- [Supplementary_names.csv](https://github.com/James-Kitson/Biogeography/blob/master/Metadata/Supplementary_names.csv) - A datafile containing MrBayes codes and informative names for supplementary tree plotting.
